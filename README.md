## Design

### Colors Used

- Black color used as main color for text on the website to make it easy to read.

- Red background color for the header as well as the footer to provide a sense of casino feeling for the user.

- For the h2 elements i have used a black background with white color text to not distract the user from the main background image.


### Font types Used

- Trebuchet MS was used as the font throughout the website as i thought it gave a comic game like feeling which makes sense in card games.

- Change the css for the page to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

- Add more in depth content such as a betting system with fake money and a way to show highscores.
